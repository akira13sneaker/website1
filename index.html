        <p class="blahblah">AKIRA (アキラ) is a 1988 Japanese animated sci-fi action film directed Katsuhiro Otomo, written by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto, produced by TMS Entertainment and several partnered Japanese animation/tech companies all referred as The AKIRA Committee. The film features the voices of Mitsuo Iwata, Nozomu Sasaki, Mami Koyama, and Taro Ishida. It is an adaption on Otomo's manga AKIRA, focusing mainly on the first half of the story.

                The film depicts a dystopian version of Tokyo in the year 2019, with cyberpunk tones. The plot focuses more on the emotional involvement of Tetsuo Shima and his long-term friend Shotaro Kaneda. While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the original 2182-page manga, the restructured plot of the movie differs considerably, pruning much of the last half due to time constraint. This decision also was possibly made to avoid controversies with the contents in the manga.
                
                The film became a hugely popular cult film around the world, and is widely considered to be a landmark in feature-length animation.</p>
